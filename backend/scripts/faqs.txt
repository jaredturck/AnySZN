"Do you offer refunds or returns?","Yes, we do. If you’re not completely happy with your order, you can return eligible items within our returns window (subject to our returns policy) for a refund or store credit. Items must be unworn, unwashed, and with original tags attached."
"How long do orders take to ship?","Shipping times depend on your location and the brand your items are coming from, but most orders are processed within a few business days. You’ll see an estimated delivery timeframe at checkout, and we’ll send you tracking details as soon as your order has been dispatched."
"How much does shipping cost?","Shipping costs vary based on your location, order size, and delivery option. The final shipping fee will be clearly shown at checkout before you confirm your order, and we occasionally offer free shipping promotions which will also be highlighted there."
"How do I know which size to order?","Each product page includes a size guide or brand-specific sizing information to help you find the best fit. If you’re between sizes, we recommend checking the measurements and any fit notes, or contacting our support team for extra guidance."
"Can I track my order?","Yes. Once your order has been shipped, you’ll receive a confirmation email with a tracking link. You can use this link to follow your parcel’s journey and get the most up-to-date delivery information."
"Can I use a gift card to pay for my order?","Absolutely. At checkout, simply select gift card as your payment method and enter your gift card details. If your gift card doesn’t cover the full amount, you can pay the remaining balance with another available payment method."
