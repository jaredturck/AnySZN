                <h2>1. About NESZN</h2>

                <p>

                    products from multiple third-party brands around the world (the "Brands"). We source

                    NESZN is an independent retailer and is not the manufacturer of the products offered
                    unless explicitly stated otherwise on the relevant product page.

                    Terms by reference.

                    to any portion of the Site, our servers, or any associated systems or networks.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be required to create an account to access certain features of the Site or to
                    complete a purchase. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide
                    is accurate, complete and up to date, and for maintaining the confidentiality of your
                    login credentials. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your
                    account.
                </p>

                    You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorised use of your account or
                    any other breach of security. NESZN shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising
                    from your failure to safeguard your account information.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Products, Descriptions and Availability</h2>

                <p>
                    NESZN acts as a retailer of products supplied by numerous Brands. We make reasonable
                    efforts to ensure that product descriptions, images, prices and availability information
                    on the Site are accurate and up to date; however, errors, inaccuracies and omissions may
                    occur. Colours and appearance of products may vary depending on your device display and
                    other factors, and are therefore provided for illustrative purposes only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All products and prices are subject to change at any time without notice. We reserve the
                    right to limit quantities, discontinue products, or refuse any order placed with us, at
                    our sole discretion. If we change or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you using
                    the contact details you provided at the time the order was placed.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Ordering and Contract Formation</h2>

                <p>
                    By placing an order through the Site, you make an offer to purchase the products in your
                    basket in accordance with these Terms. After you place an order, you will receive an email
                    acknowledging receipt of your order. This acknowledgement does not constitute acceptance
                    of your order.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A binding contract between you and NESZN is formed only when we send you an order
                    confirmation email stating that your order has been accepted and dispatched. We reserve
                    the right to refuse any order for any reason, including but not limited to product
                    unavailability, pricing or description errors, or suspected fraud.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Prices, Taxes and Delivery Charges</h2>

                <p>
                    All prices displayed on the Site are in the currency specified on the Site and, unless
                    stated otherwise, include applicable sales taxes. Delivery charges, duties and other
                    fees (if any) will be added to your order total and clearly displayed at checkout before
                    you confirm your purchase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We take reasonable care to ensure that prices are correct at the time of publication.
                    However, if we discover an error in the price of a product you have ordered, we reserve
                    the right to cancel the order or to contact you to confirm whether you wish to proceed
                    at the correct price.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Payment and Security</h2>

                <p>
                    We accept various payment methods, including major credit and debit cards, digital
                    wallets and third-party payment providers, as indicated on the Site from time to time.
                    By submitting payment information, you represent and warrant that you are authorised to
                    use the selected payment method and that the payment details provided are accurate and
                    complete.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Payments are processed through secure third-party payment gateways using industry-standard
                    encryption technologies designed to protect your financial information in transit. While
                    we take reasonable technical and organisational measures to safeguard your data, no
                    transmission of data over the internet or electronic storage system can be guaranteed
                    to be 100% secure. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept liability
                    for any loss arising from unauthorised access to your payment information that occurs
                    outside of our reasonable control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your use of certain payment options (including, without limitation, “buy now, pay later”
                    services, digital wallets or credit providers) may be subject to additional terms and
                    conditions imposed by those third-party providers. You are responsible for reviewing and
                    complying with such third-party terms.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Delivery and Risk of Loss</h2>

                <p>
                    Estimated delivery times and shipping options will be displayed at checkout and may vary
                    depending on your location, the products ordered and the selected carrier. Any delivery
                    dates provided are estimates only and are not guaranteed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Risk of loss and title to the products pass to you when the products are delivered to the
                    delivery address specified in your order. NESZN shall not be liable for any delay or
                    failure to deliver products due to events beyond our reasonable control, including but
                    not limited to strikes, carrier delays, customs checks, natural disasters or other
                    force majeure events.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Returns, Exchanges and Refunds</h2>

                <p>
                    Your rights to return products and receive refunds or exchanges are set out in our
                    Returns and Refunds Policy, which forms part of these Terms. In general, products must
                    be returned in their original condition (unworn, unwashed, with tags attached and in
                    original packaging) within the applicable return period, subject to any statutory rights
                    you may have under consumer protection laws.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Certain products may be excluded from returns for hygiene or other reasons (for example,
                    underwear, swimwear, or personalised items), as specified in our Returns and Refunds
                    Policy and/or on the product page. NESZN reserves the right to refuse a refund or
                    exchange where returned products do not meet the conditions set out in the applicable
                    policy.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Gift Cards and Store Credit</h2>

                <p>
                    NESZN may offer digital or physical gift cards, as well as store credits, which can be
                    used to purchase eligible products on the Site. Gift cards and credits are typically
                    non-refundable, non-transferable (except as required by law) and cannot be exchanged
                    for cash, except where required by applicable law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additional terms may apply to the purchase and use of gift cards and credits, including
                    expiry dates, restrictions and usage limits. Such terms will be made available at the
                    point of purchase or on the Site.
