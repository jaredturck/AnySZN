                <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

                <p>
                    This Cookie Policy explains how NESZN ("NESZN", "we", "us" or "our") uses cookies and similar
                    technologies on our website and online store (the "Site"). It should be read together with
                    our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Policy is intended to comply with applicable UK law, including the UK General Data
                    Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR"), the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and
                    Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ("PECR"), as amended. PECR
                    sets specific rules for storing information or gaining access to information stored on
                    a user’s device (for example, via cookies), and these rules apply in addition to UK GDPR
                    where the data involved is personal data.
                </p>

                <h2>1. What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?</h2>

                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your device (such as a computer,
                    tablet or smartphone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites
                    work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owner.
                    Cookies can be "session" cookies (which expire when you close your browser) or
                    "persistent" cookies (which stay on your device for a set period or until you delete
                    them).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also use technologies similar to cookies, such as pixels, tags, local storage,
                    SDKs and scripts, which can perform similar functions (collectively, "cookies" for the
                    purposes of this Policy). These technologies allow us and certain third parties to
                    store or access information on your device.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Legal Framework and Consent</h2>

                <p>
                    Under PECR, we must:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tell you clearly and comprehensively about the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them; and</li>
                    <li>Obtain your consent before storing non-essential cookies or accessing information stored on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Only cookies that are "strictly necessary" for the provision of an online service you
                    have explicitly requested (for example, remembering items in your basket or maintaining
                    a secure login session) are exempt from the consent requirement. All other cookies,
                    including most analytics, personalisation and advertising cookies, require your
                    prior, opt-in consent that meets the standards of the UK GDPR (freely given,
                    specific, informed and unambiguous, given by a clear affirmative action).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where cookies involve the processing of personal data, we also rely on an appropriate
                    lawful basis under the UK GDPR (for example, consent or our legitimate interests, as
                    described in our Privacy Policy).
                </p>

                <h2>3. How We Obtain Your Consent</h2>

                <p>
                    When you first visit our Site, you will see a cookie banner or preference tool which:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Provides clear information about the categories of cookies we use;</li>
                    <li>Allows you to accept or reject non-essential cookies, or to manage your preferences by category; and</li>
                    <li>Operates on a basis of genuine choice, meaning non-essential cookies are not set unless and until you have consented.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You can withdraw or change your consent at any time by adjusting your cookie settings
                    via the link or icon provided on the Site (for example, “Cookie Settings” or similar),
                    or by changing your browser settings as described below. Withdrawal of consent does not
                    affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before it was withdrawn.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

                <p>
                    We group the cookies used on our Site into the following categories. The specific cookies,
                    their providers and lifespans may change over time; we will update this Policy or our
                    cookie preference tool to reflect material changes.
                </p>

                <h3>4.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>

                <p>
                    These cookies are essential for the operation of the Site and for enabling you to move
                    around it and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, managing your shopping
                    basket and completing checkout. Without these cookies, services you have requested
                    cannot be provided. Because they are strictly necessary, they do not require your
                    consent, but they are still covered by this Policy.
                </p>

                <h3>4.2 Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>

                <p>
                    These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site, such as which pages
                    are visited most often, how users move around the Site and whether they receive error
                    messages. We use this information in aggregated form to help us understand and improve
                    the performance of the Site and to develop new features and services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where these cookies are not strictly necessary, they will only be set with your consent.
                    Examples include cookies placed by web analytics services (for example, to generate
                    statistics about traffic and usage patterns).
                </p>

                <h3>4.3 Functionality Cookies</h3>

                <p>
                    Functionality cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your
                    language, region or saved items) and provide enhanced, more personalised features.
                    These cookies may also be used to provide services you have requested, such as live
                    chat support or remembering your login details (where you choose this option).
                </p>

                <p>
                    These cookies are generally non-essential and will only be used with your consent, unless
                    they are strictly necessary to deliver a feature you have requested.
                </p>

                <h3>4.4 Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h3>

                <p>
                    These cookies are used to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your
                    interests, both on our Site and on third-party sites and apps. They may also be used to
                    limit the number of times you see an advert and to help measure the effectiveness of
                    advertising campaigns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These cookies are often set by third-party advertising networks or social media
                    platforms. They may build a profile of your interests based on your browsing activity
                    and may track you across different websites and devices. We will only use advertising or
                    targeting cookies with your prior consent.
                </p>

                <h3>4.5 Social Media Cookies</h3>

                <p>
                    Our Site may include social media features or plug-ins (such as "like" or "share"
                    buttons). These features may set cookies that allow the social media platform to track
                    your activity on our Site or link your visit to your account on that platform. The use
                    of such cookies is governed by the privacy and cookie policies of the relevant social
                    media providers, and we encourage you to review those policies separately.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Cookies</h2>

                <p>
                    Some cookies on our Site are set by third parties acting on our behalf (for example,
                    analytics providers, payment processors or service providers who help us operate the
                    Site), and some are set by independent third parties who may combine information
                    collected through cookies with other data they hold about you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We contractually require third parties acting as our processors to process personal data
                    obtained via cookies only on our documented instructions, to keep it secure and to
                    comply with applicable data protection laws. Where third parties act as independent
                    controllers (for example, certain advertising networks or social media platforms),
                    their collection and use of your data is subject to their own privacy and cookie
                    policies, which we do not control.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Retention Periods</h2>

                <p>
                    The length of time a cookie remains on your device varies. Some cookies are session
                    cookies that last only for the duration of your browser session; others are persistent
                    cookies that are stored for a defined period and activated each time you visit the Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We aim to ensure that cookies and similar technologies are not kept for longer than is
                    necessary for the purposes for which they are used. Details of typical lifespans for
                    each cookie category are available in our cookie preference tool or on request.
                </p>

                <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>

                <p>
                    Some of our third-party providers (for example, analytics or advertising partners) may
                    be located outside the United Kingdom or may store data on servers located outside the
                    UK. Where the cookies they set result in the transfer of personal data to countries that
                    do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK, we will ensure that
                    appropriate safeguards are in place, such as approved international data transfer
                    agreements or standard contractual clauses, in accordance with UK GDPR requirements.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Managing Cookies</h2>

                <p>
                    You can manage your cookie preferences in several ways:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By using our on-site cookie preference tool or banner to accept, reject or configure
                        non-essential cookies by category; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By adjusting your browser settings to block or delete cookies. Most browsers allow you
                        to refuse some or all cookies and to delete cookies that have already been set. Please
                        note that disabling or blocking certain cookies may affect the functionality and
                        performance of the Site and may prevent you from using some features.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Instructions for managing cookies can usually be found in the "Help" section of your
                    browser or on the browser provider’s website. You may also visit industry-wide opt-out
                    platforms (where available) for interest-based advertising, although these tools are
                    provided by third parties and we do not control or endorse them.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Relationship with Our Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    Where cookies or similar technologies collect or involve personal data, that data will
                    also be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which provides more detailed
                    information about how we collect, use, disclose and protect personal data, as well as
                    your rights under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Updates to This Cookie Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in
                    the cookies we use, in our practices or in applicable law (including updates to PECR,
                    UK GDPR or related guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office). When we make
                    material changes, we will take appropriate steps to notify you, such as by posting a
                    prominent notice on the Site or updating our cookie banner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "Last updated" date below indicates when this Cookie Policy was most recently
                    revised. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how
                    we use cookies and similar technologies.
                </p>
