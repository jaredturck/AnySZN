                <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>

                <p>
                    Some of the recipients described above may be located outside the United Kingdom, in
                    countries whose data protection laws may not provide the same level of protection as the
                    UK. Where we transfer your personal data outside the UK, we will ensure that appropriate
                    safeguards are in place to protect it in accordance with applicable law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Such safeguards may include the use of approved international data transfer agreements
                    or standard contractual clauses, reliance on adequacy regulations issued by the UK
                    government, or other lawful transfer mechanisms. Further information about the specific
                    safeguards used for a given transfer can be provided upon request.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>

                <p>
                    We retain your personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the
                    purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal,
                    regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements, and for the establishment,
                    exercise or defence of legal claims.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When determining the appropriate retention period, we consider factors such as the
                    nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
                    disclosure, the purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those
                    purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements. After the
                    relevant retention period has expired, we will securely delete or anonymise your
                    personal data.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Data Security</h2>

                <p>
                    We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect your
                    personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
                    disclosure or access. These measures may include, among others, encryption, access
                    controls, firewalls, secure hosting environments, regular security testing and staff
                    training.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While we strive to protect your personal data, no system or transmission over the
                    internet is completely secure. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials
                    confidential and for using appropriate security measures on your own devices and
                    networks. If you suspect any unauthorised access to your account or other breach of
                    security, please notify us immediately.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>

                <p>
                    We may use limited forms of profiling to tailor our marketing communications, recommend
                    products and personalise your experience on the Site, for example by suggesting products
                    based on your browsing or purchase history. These activities do not typically produce
                    legal or similarly significant effects on you, but you have the right to object to such
                    profiling as described below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we ever use automated decision-making (including profiling) that produces legal
                    effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, we will provide you with
                    specific information about the logic involved, the significance and the envisaged
                    consequences of such processing, as required by law, and we will ensure that appropriate
                    safeguards are in place.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Right to object:</strong> to object, on grounds relating to your particular

                        <strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> where we rely on your consent for

                        affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
