1) How do you integrate Stripe into the website?
The AnySzn architecture (what we’re building)

You’re not doing “normal Stripe” (one merchant). You’re doing a marketplace:

AnySzn = platform

Each brand = connected account

Customer can pay once for a multi-brand basket

Stripe automatically routes funds to each brand

The Stripe products you’d use:

Stripe Connect for brand onboarding + routing funds

A payment UI for customers (either Stripe Checkout or Stripe Elements/Payment Element)

Brand onboarding

Build a “Connect Stripe” button in the brand dashboard.

That button redirects the brand to a Stripe-hosted onboarding form, and Stripe collects all required business + identity info (KYC), dynamically based on country/business type.

Payments

For marketplace routing where brands are responsible, we use Direct Charges:

The charge is created on the connected brand’s account

The payment appears on the brand’s account, and the brand’s balance increases

If you take a platform fee, Stripe transfers that fee to AnySzn

Stripe explicitly defines merchant of record for Direct Charges as the connected account (the brand).

“But a basket has multiple brands… how do Direct Charges handle that?”

A single card payment can only have one merchant of record. So with multi-brand baskets you typically do one of these:

The common marketplace pattern for “one payment” + “split to multiple brands” is:

Use Destination Charges (platform takes the payment, then routes funds to multiple connected accounts) OR

Use “separate charges per brand” (multiple payments)

If your top priority is one checkout + multi-brand split, in practice you usually end up using Destination Charges + transfers to split per brand. Stripe’s destination charge model is designed to create the charge on the platform and transfer funds to connected accounts.

If you want brands to be merchant of record (so brands handle refunds/disputes), Stripe also supports configurations where the connected account is merchant of record for indirect payments using on_behalf_of—this is part of how marketplaces align MoR correctly depending on the flow. 
Stripe Docs

What I’d do for AnySzn MVP:

Use Stripe Checkout or Payment Element for customer payment UI (fast + secure)

Use Connect for onboarding

Implement a split logic that maps each basket line item to a brand and routes funds appropriately (with the safest MoR configuration for your operating model)

2) What will the payment process look like to the end customer?

You have 3 UI options. All are Stripe-supported:

Option A — Stripe Checkout (hosted page)

Customer clicks “Pay”

Redirect to a Stripe-hosted payment page

Customer enters card / Apple Pay / etc.

Redirect back to AnySzn success page

Stripe describes Checkout as a prebuilt payment page that Stripe hosts (or can be embedded), and you can redirect customers after payment using return_url.

Pros: fastest to build, best conversion, lowest PCI burden
Cons: customer sees a Stripe page (still normal and trusted)

Option B — Embedded Stripe Checkout (still Checkout, but inside your page)

The payment form appears embedded on your checkout page

Still powered by Stripe Checkout Sessions

You control the surrounding AnySzn UI

Stripe supports embedded Checkout and explains embedded vs Stripe-hosted.

Pros: feels “native” on AnySzn, still low-code
Cons: slightly more integration work than hosted

Option C — Stripe Elements / Payment Element (fully in your UI)

Customer fills payment details directly in an AnySzn form

The sensitive fields are Stripe components (tokenized), not your servers

Most “custom checkout” look and feel

Stripe’s Payment Element is their recommended embeddable UI with built-in validation, masking, localization, and payment-method logic.

Pros: best branding control, can match AnySzn design perfectly
Cons: more engineering effort than Checkout

My recommendation for AnySzn:

Start with Stripe Checkout (hosted or embedded) to ship faster and reduce edge cases.

Move to Payment Element once you’re iterating on conversion and UX.

3) Do brands (e.g., “Zara”) need to fill out a form for Stripe to process payments for that brand?
Yes — every brand must be onboarded/verified (KYC), even big brands.

Not because they’re “sellers,” but because they’re the party receiving funds. Stripe requires onboarding connected accounts; the easiest method is Stripe-hosted onboarding, which collects business + identity verification info.

What the brand actually does (simple version)

In the AnySzn brand dashboard:

Click Connect Stripe

Complete Stripe’s onboarding form (business + bank details)

Return to AnySzn (Stripe redirects back to your return_url) 
Stripe Docs

Brand is now “payment enabled”

How long it takes

Typically 2–5 minutes if they have details ready

Occasionally longer if Stripe requests extra verification docs

Important nuance for “brands like Zara”

Zara is unlikely to “just onboard” like an indie brand; they’ll have legal/compliance procurement steps.

For enterprise brands, you’d often start with:

a pilot group of mid-size Shopify brands (fast onboarding)

then approach enterprise brands once you can prove conversion + operational stability

How I’d make this work cleanly for AnySzn (practical playbook)
Brand side (onboarding & ops)

Brand dashboard: Connect Stripe → Stripe-hosted onboarding 
Stripe Docs
+1

Brand sets:

return policy link

shipping rules (or “fulfilled by brand”)

support contact

Customer side (checkout UX)

AnySzn checkout shows:

one address form

one payment step (Stripe Checkout hosted/embedded)

order summary grouped by brand

Post-purchase:

AnySzn sends one master confirmation

Brands handle fulfilment + tracking, while AnySzn shows a unified “My Orders” view (best UX)

Refunds/disputes (your earlier question)

If you configure the flow so brands are merchant of record, they can handle refunds/disputes for their portion. Stripe’s guidance around merchant of record and direct charges is explicit.

(Practically: you still want AnySzn to route support, but the financial action sits with the brand.)
